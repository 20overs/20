         In the summer of 2012, there was a high adrenaline rushing cricket game being played between two college teams in Chennai, India. While watching that game, the founders of 20overs.com realized that, while there are plenty of websites that cover international and some domestic level cricket games, there is no website available to record college level and school level games. That's when the idea of 20overs.com was born.</p>
        <p class="single font-source h4">
        We are a team of programmers that are working frenetically to make it the best experience for people looking for local games. We are here to take local cricket to the next level.</P>
